# arrange-act-assert-pattern

I'm fan of the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. Test cases may become hard to read if this pattern is not used, or used via comments. In addition you never know if a test fails during the arrange, act, or assert phase. Based on that I decided to write a library making unit tests more readable.
